We had the task of answering various questions related to upgrading
Red Hat Quay 3.3 to 3.4 and to 3.5 with the help of the quay-operator.

Thankfully (sic!) everything changed in regards to the Quay operator
between Quay 3.3 and Quay 3.4.

So this is a brain dump of the things to consider.

* Operator changes

  With Quay 3.4 the operator was completely reworked and it basically
  changed from opinionated to *very* opinionated. The upgrade works
  quite well but you have to be aware about the following points:

  - The name of the custom resource changed from ~QuayEcosystem~ to ~QuayRegistry~
  - The ~configHostname~, used for providing the quay configuration UI, is no longer configurable
  - The password for the configuration UI is *always* regenerated after a configuration re-deployment
  - The volume size of the PostgreSQL PVC will change to 50G

  In my test cluster I was using a 10G Ceph block device and the
  StorageClass did not support volume expansion. So my upgrade stopped
  at this point and I had to allow volume expansion in the storage
  class.

  - A horizontal pod autoscaler is also deploy during the upgrade. The
    default is to scale automatically to 20 pods, you might reconsider this...
  - With the Quay operator version 3.5 the operator is monitoring all
    namespaces for custom resources and needs to be installed in the
    openshift-operators namespace, this is how we upgraded Quay to 3.5
    including the operator:
    - change the quay operator channel to 3.5
    - trigger an upgrade
    - now Quay gets upgraded to version 3.5
    - after the Quay upgrade you need to reinstall the operator:
      - deinstall the quay operator, Quay is *not* affected by this
      - reinstall the Quay operator (3.5) in all-namespaces
      - the re-installation of the operator triggers a quay deployment,
        all Quay pods are restarted!
  - You have to manually cleanup old
    - postgres-config-secrets and
    - quay-config-bundle's

* Backup and restore considerations

  Red Hat is working on providing documentation on how to backup and
  restore Quay in various scenarios. There's an open task for this
  that provides more information
