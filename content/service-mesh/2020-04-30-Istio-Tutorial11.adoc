To test a second application, a bookinfo application shall be deployed as an example. 

The following section finds it's origin at:

* https://istio.io/docs/examples/bookinfo/[Istio - Bookinfo Application^]
* https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/service_mesh/service_mesh_day_two/ossm-example-bookinfo.html[OpenShift 4 - Example Application^]

The Bookinfo application displays information about a book, similar to a single catalog entry of an online book store. 
Displayed on the page is a description of the book, book details (ISBN, number of pages, and other information), and book reviews.

The Bookinfo application consists of these microservices:

* The productpage microservice calls the details and reviews microservices to populate the page.
* The details microservice contains book information.
* The reviews microservice contains book reviews. It also calls the ratings microservice.
* The ratings microservice contains book ranking information that accompanies a book review.

There are three versions of the reviews microservice:

* Version v1 does not call the ratings Service.
* Version v2 calls the ratings Service and displays each rating as one to five black stars.
* Version v3 calls the ratings Service and displays each rating as one to five red stars.

The end-to-end architecture of the application is shown below.

To use the bookinfo application inside service mesh, no code changes are required. Instead an Envoy proxy is added as a sidecar container to all containers (product, review, details) which intercepts the traffic.

== Installation
Let's start right away:

. Create a new project
+
[source, bash]
----
oc new-project bookinfo
----

. Add the new project to our Service Mesh
+
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshMember
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: bookinfo
spec:
  controlPlaneRef:
    name: basic-install
    namespace: istio-system
----

. Create the application
+
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -n bookinfo -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio/maistra-1.1/samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml
----

. Create the Gateway and the VirtuaService
+
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -n bookinfo -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio/maistra-1.1/samples/bookinfo/networking/bookinfo-gateway.yaml
----

. Check if the services and pods are up and running
+
[source,bash]
----
oc get svc,pods
NAME                  TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
service/details       ClusterIP   172.30.178.172   <none>        9080/TCP   7m16s
service/productpage   ClusterIP   172.30.78.96     <none>        9080/TCP   7m13s

NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

== Verify that application is accessible

. Export the Gateway URL into a variable
+
[source,bash]
----
export GATEWAY_URL=$(oc -n istio-system get route istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
----

. Verify if the productpage is accessible
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -s http://${GATEWAY_URL}/productpage | grep -o "<title>.*</title>"
<title>Simple Bookstore App</title>
----

. You can also access the Productpage in your browser. When you reload the page several times, you will see different results for the Reviews. This comes due to 3 different versions: one without any rating, one with black stars and one with red stars. http://${GATEWAY_URL}/productpage

== Adding default Destination Rule

[source,bash]
----
oc apply -n bookinfo -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio/maistra-1.1/samples/bookinfo/networking/destination-rule-all-mtls.yaml
----

This will add default routing to all endpoints with same weight. As you can see in Kiali, the _Reviews_ microservice is contacted equally.

Feel free to play with other DestinationRules to controll your traffic.
