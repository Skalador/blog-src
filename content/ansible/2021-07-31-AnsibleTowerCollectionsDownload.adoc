Every wondered why Ansible Tower does not start downloading required
collections when you synchronize a project? Here are the stumbling
blocks we discovered so far:

<!--more--> 

== Wrong name for requirements.yml

When downloading collections Ansible Tower searches for a file
`requirements.yml` in the collections directory.

Be careful with the file extension: `requirements.yml` has to end with
the extension `.yml` and *not* `.yaml`.

== Collections download is disabled in Ansible Tower

Within Ansible Tower there is a setting called `ENABLE COLLECTION(S)
DOWNLOAD` under `Settings`/`Jobs`. This has to be set to true, which
is also the default.

== No Ansible Galaxy credential defined for the organization

Last but not least an Ansible Galaxy credential needs to be defined
for the organization where the project is defined. With the default
installation of Ansible Tower, when the sample playbooks are installed
there is a credential called `Ansible Galaxy` defined. You need to assign
this credential to the organization.

If you skip installing the sample playbooks, *no* `Ansible Galaxy`
credential will be defined for you and you have to create it manually.

== How does this actually work?

Ansible Tower uses a Python virtual environment for running
Ansible. The default environment is installed in
`/var/lib/awx/venv/awx`. You can also create custom environments, see
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/upgrade-migration-guide/virtualenv.html[Using virtualenv with Ansible Tower].

In the default setup the following files define how collections are downloaded:

* `lib/python3.6/site-packages/awx/main/tasks.py`
* `lib/python3.6/site-packages/awx/playbooks/project_update.yml`

=== task.py

`task.py` defines various internal tasks Tower has to run on various
occasions. For example in line number 1930 (Ansible Tower 3.8.3) the
task `RunProjectUpdate` gets defined. This is the task Tower
has to run whenever a project update is required.

In our case the function `build_extra_vars_file` (line 2083 with
Ansible Tower 3.8.3) defines the variable `galaxy_creds_are_defined`
only if the organization has a galaxy credential defined (line 2099
Ansible Tower 3.8.3).

Line 2120 (Ansible Tower 3.8.3) finally defines the Ansible extra
variable `collections_enabled` depending on
`galaxy_creds_are_defined`.

=== project_update.yml

So `task.py` defines the extra variable `collections_enabled` (see
above). Finally the playbook `project_update.yml` consumes this extra
variable and only downloads collections if `collections_enabled` is
set to `true`, see the block string at line 192 (Ansible Tower 3.8.3)
in `project_update.yml.

So long and thanks for all the fish!
