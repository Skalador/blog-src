Notes taken during Red Hat course D410 Ansible and Ansible Tower.

<!--more--> 

== Ansible installation

- make sure that _libselinux-python_ is installed
- Ansible 2.7 requires python 2.6 or 3.5

[source,bash]
-----------
yum list installed python
-----------

- windows modules implemented in powershell
- ansible requires at least .net 4.0

== Configuration files

Ansible searches for ansible.cfg in the following order:

- $ANSIBLE_CFG
- ansible.cfg in the current directory
- $HOME/ansible.cfg
- /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

whichever it finds first will be used.

use

[source,bash]
--------
ansible --version
--------

to see which config file is currently used. you can view/dump/see what changed with

[source,bash]
------------
ansible-config [list|dump|view]
------------

=== Default modules

List all available modules via

[source,bash]
----------
ansible-doc -l
----------

For getting help on a specific module use

[source,bash]
-----------
ansible-doc ping
-----------

== Ad-hoc commmands

To display ansible output on a single line per host for easier readablility use the _-o_ option

[source,bash]
-----------
ansible all -m command -a /bin/hostname -o
-----------

Use the raw module for directly executing commands on remote systems that do not have python installed.

[source,bash]
---------
ansible -m raw
---------

== Custom Facts

Ansible uses custom facts from _/etc/ansible/facts.d/_. Facts can be
stored in .ini style or you can place executable scripts in this
directory. The script needs to output JSON. Custom facts are available via _ansible_facts.ansible_local_.

== Magic variables available

- hostvars: variables defined for this host
- group_names: list of groups this host is a member of
- groups: list of all groups and hosts in the inventory
- inventory_hostname: host name of the current host as configured in the inventory

== Matching hosts in the inventory

Some examples on how to match hosts defined in the inventory

- '*.lab.com': match all hosts starting with lab.com
- 'lab,datacenter': match all hosts either in lab or datacenter
- 'datacenter*': match all host *and host groups* starting with datacenter
- 'lab,&datacenter': match hosts in the lab and datacenter group
- 'datacenter,!test.lab.com': match all hosts in datacenter, except _test.lab.com_

== Dynamic inventory

Example scripts for dynamic inventories can be found at
https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/contrib/inventory.

You can use `ansible-inventory` to take a look a the current inventory
as json. This also works for static inventories.

Inventories can be combined. Just create a directory containing a
static inventory and script to create a dynamic inventory, ansible
will happily execute the scripts and merge everything together.

== Debugging

The following might be useful when debugging ansible roles and playbooks

[source,bash]
-------------
ansible-playbook play.yml --syntax-check
ansible-playbook play.yml --step
ansible-playbook play.yml --start-at-task="start httpd service"
ansible-playbook --check play.yml
ansible-playbook --check --diff play.yml
-------------

== Ansible Tower

Notes on deploying and working with ansible tower.

=== Installation

System requirements:

- at least 4GB of RAM
- actual requirement depends on _forks_ variable
- recommendation is 100MB memory for each for + 2GB of memory for tower services
- 20GB of disk storage, at least 10GB in /var

Steps for installing:

- download setup tar.gz from http://releases.ansible.com/ansible-tower/setup/
- set passwords in _inventory_
- run _./setup.sh_

=== Authentication

Authentication settings can be changed under Settings /
Authentication. E.g for configuring Azure AD authentication we are
going to need

- an Azure AD oauth2 key and
- a Azure AD oauth2 secret

=== RBAC

- separate roles for organizations and inventories
- you need to assign roles to organizations and inventories

=== The Tower Flow

These are the steps to run playbooks against managed nodes in Tower:

- Create an organization if required
- Create users
- Create teams and assign users
- Create credentials for accessing managed nodes
- Assign credential to organization
- Create credentials for accessing SCM repositories (e.g. git)
- Assign credentials to users or teams
- Create a project
- Assign Teams to project
- Create a job template for executing playbooks

=== Ansible Roles support

If the project includes a `requirements.txt` file in the _roles/_ folder, tower will automatically run

[source,bash]
----------
ansible-galaxy install -r roles/requirements.yml -p ./roles/ --force
----------

at the end of an update. So this could be used to include external
dependencies (like SAP ansible roles).

=== Job Templates

Ansible playbooks are stored in GIT repositories. A job template defines

- the inventory used for this job template
- the project for executing this job
  - this connects the GIT repository used in this project with the template
- the playbook to execute
- the credentials for executing jobs
- permissions for users / teams (e.g. admin, execute)

Tower creates jobs from those templates, which are ansible runs
executed against managed nodes.

=== Fact Caching

It might be a good idea to use the tower facts cache. To speed up
playbook runs set `gather_facts: no` in the play. Then enable the
facts cache in tower.

- In tower settings set a timeout for the cache
- In job templates enable `Use facts cache`
- Create a playbook that runs on a regular basis to gather facts, e.g.

[source, ansible]
---------
- name: Refresh fact cache
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: yes
---------

=== Inventory options

These are the options for creating inventories in Ansible Tower

- static inventory defined in tower
- importing static inventories via _awx-manage_
- static inventory defined in git repository
- dynamic inventory via a custom script
- dynamic inventory provides by tower (e.g. satellite)

A special feature in Tower are so called *smart inventories*. A smart
inventory combines all static and dynamic inventories and allows
filtering based on facts. Filtering requires a valid fact cache.

=== Troubleshooting

Tower uses the following components:

- postgresql
- nginx
- memcached
- rabbitmq
- supervisord

Useful tools

- _ansible-tower-service_ (e.g. status / restart)
- _supervisorctl_ (e.g. status)
- _awx-manage_

Tower stores log files in

- _/var/log/tower/_ (e.g. tower.log).
- _/var/log/supervisor/_
- _/var/log/nginx/_

Other important directories

- _/var/lib/awx/public/static_ static files served by django
- _/var/lib/awx/projects_ stores all project related files e.g. git checkouts)
- _/var/lib/awx/jobs_status_ job status output

NOTE: by default playbook runs are confined to _/tmp_ this might lead
to problems with tasks running on the local system.

In case of a lost _admin_ password you can use _awx-manage_ to reset the password or create a new superuser:

[source, bash]
----------
awx-manage changepassword admin
awx-manage createsuperuser
----------

=== Replacing the default TLS certificates

Ansible tower uses nginx to service it's web interface over TLS. Nginx
uses the configuration file _/etc/nginx/nginx.conf_.

To deploy custom TLS certificates used by tower replace the
certificate and private key in _/etc/tower_. You have to replace

- _/etc/tower/tower.crt_ and
- _/etc/tower/tower.key_

It might be a good idea to create a backup copy before overwriting
those files.

=== Backup and restore

Of course backup and restore are done via ansible. The ansible tower
setup script `setup.sh` provides a wrapper around these playbooks. Execute

[source,bash]
-----------
setup.sh -b
-----------

to perform a backup. This creates a backup .tar.gz file in the current directory.

To restore a backup use

[source,bash]
-----------
setup.sh -r
-----------

this restores the latest backup per default.

== Things to remember

- Workflow job templates
- add `autocmd FileType yaml setlocal ai ts=2 sw=2 et` to .vimrc
- use `sudo yum install python-cryptography` if there are many vault files to speed up ansible
