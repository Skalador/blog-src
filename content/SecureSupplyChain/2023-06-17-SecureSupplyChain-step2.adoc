We will now create the Pipeline and try to trigger it for the first time to verify if our Webhook works as intended.

<!--more--> 

== Goals

The goals of this step are:

* Create the **Pipeline** with a first task
* Update the Github repository, to verify if the Webhook works 
* Verify if the PipelineRun is successful

== Create the Pipeline

. The Pipeline object is responsible to define the Tasks (steps) that should be executed. Whenever a Pipeline is started a PipelineRun is created that performs each defined Task in the defined order and logs the output. Tasks can run subsequently or in parallel.
+
Currently, the Pipeline has one task **pull-source-code** which is defined as a ClusterTask "git-clone". The purpose is to simply pull the source code to the workspace "shared-data".

The initial Pipeline will now look like the following (Go to: Pipelines > Pipelines > secure-supply-chain)

== Our first Run

Now it is time to update something in our Git Repository and verify if everything can be executed successfully. 

To update, it is enough to simply add a space in the **README.md** file and push it to Git. 

If the Webhook works as expected, Git will notify our EventListener, which will then trigger the Pipeline. 
A PipelineRun is created, that executes all Tasks that are defined in the Pipeline (currently just 1)

You can monitor the progress of the PipelineRun:

.PipelineRun Overview

On the Details-page you can see which step is currently executed: 

.PipelineRun Details

Eventually, the PipelineRun finishes successfully.

You can analyze the Logs in case of an Error or to get more details of a certain Task:

== Summary
We have now created our first Pipeline and tested the GitHub Webhook. Whenever we push changes to the code, Git will notify the EventListener which will trigger the Pipeline with all required Parameters. 

A PipelineRun is generated and is executing the defined Tasks. Currently, not much is done, expect cloning the Git repository. 

In the next steps, we will evolve our Pipeline to perform security checks and sign our image.
