In this step we will install **Advanced Cluster Security** (ACS) and create 2 new steps in our Pipeline to scan the image for vulnerabilities and security policy. A custom security policy, configured in ACS, will verify if the image is signed. 

<!--more--> 

== Goals

The goals of this step are:

* Install ACS.
* Create a custom security policy into ACS.
* Configure CoSign integration in ACS.
* Create a step in the Pipeline to perform an image scan (vulnerabilities).
* Create a step in the Pipeline to perform an image check (security policies).

== Install Advanced Cluster Security (ACS)

We will install ACS on our cluster which will be called **local-cluster** inside ACS.

The deployment will happen via Argo CD (OpenShift GitOps) that will use the following Helm Chart: https://github.com/tjungbauer/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/rhacs-full-stack[RHACS^]

The Argo CD Application will trigger the deployment which will take several minutes. 

WARNING: The deployment will install a minimal version of ACS and tries to limit the required resources and replicas. For production environments, you probably want to increase the settings.

.Syncing ACS Deployment Application
image::step6-sync_acs.png?width=400px[Syncing ACS Deployment Application]

This GitOps Application will start a full-stack ACS deployment. It does (in this exact order):

. Installs the ACS Operator into rhacs-operator
. Verifies if the Operator is ready
. Creates the Namespace stackrox
. Adds a ConsoleLink in the upper right action menu of OpenShift
+
.ACS ConsoleLink
image::step6-acs_consolelink.png?width=220px[ACS ConsoleLine]

. Creates the Central custom resource with minimum resources 
. Creates an init-bundle to add the first (local) cluster
. Adds the custom resource SecureCluster to install the rest of the ACS components
. And finally, runs a basic configuration that enables authentication via OpenShift and provides the **kubeadmin** user admin privileges. This can be disabled in the values file if you prefer not to configure this, or if kubeadmin does not exist anymore in your cluster.

The whole process will take a while and uses syncwaves and hooks. 

=== Configure ACS Integration

=== Generate Authentication Token

. Create an authentication Token in ACS
+
Go to ``"Platform Configuration > Integrations > API Token"``
+
.ACS Generate Token
image::step6-acs_token.png?width=440px[ACS Generate Token]
+
Generate a new Token with at least **Continuous Integration** privileges and save the created Token. 

. Back in OpenShift, a Secret must be created with the key **rox_api_token**
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: stackrox-secret
  namespace: ci
data:
  rox_api_token: <base 64 Token> <1>
type: Opaque
----
<1> Base64 decoded ACS Token.

. Create a 2nd Secret that contains the ACS endpoint and its port:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: stackrox-endpoint
  namespace: ci
stringData:
  rox_central_endpoint: central-stackrox.apps.ocp.aws.ispworld.at:443 <1>
type: Opaque
----
<1> The endpoint URL of my example cluster. Note: the port MUST be added here.

=== Integrate CoSign with ACS

. Configure CoSign Integration
+
During link:/openshift/securesupplychain/step5/[Step 5^] we have created a CoSign key pair to sign our images. To integrate with ACS, we need to retrieve the **public key**. In OpenShift, open the Secret signing-secrets in the Namespace openshift-pipelines and extract the key cosign.pub. 
+
It will look something like tjis:
+
[source]
----
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
key...
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
----

. In ACS, go to ``"Platform Configuration > Integrations > Signature"`` and create a new CoSign integration. 
+
.ACS CoSign Integration
image::step6-acs_cosign.png?width=440px[ACS CoSign Integration]
+
Enter a name and the public key and activate this integration
+
.ACS Create CoSign Integration
image::step6-acs_cosign_int.png?width=600px[ACS Create CoSign Integration]
+
This will enable ACS to verify the CoSign signature of the image. 

=== Create a Custom Policy that verifies the Signature
Create a custom security policy, that verifies if our image has been signed or not. 

To be sure that every image is correctly signed, we create a custom security policy that verifies this signature using our CoSign integration. This policy can be configured as **inform** or **enforce**. Enforce means that the pipeline will fail (during the Task acs-image-check) if the image signature cannot be checked. 

Let's create our policy by hand for this time. However, it is also possible to export/import rules. The important part here is that link to the CoSign integration is valid, otherwise ACS cannot verify the signature.

. Open ``"Platform Configuration > Policy > and click the button Create Policy"``
. Name: **Trusted Signature Policy**
. Severity: **High**
. Categories: **Security Best Practices**
. Click **Next**
. Lifecycle stage: check **Build** and **Deploy**
. Response method: **Inform and enforce** > This will make the Task in the Pipeline fail when the signature cannot be verified.
. Configure enforcement behavior:
.. Activate: **Enforce on Build** > Only fail for build lifecycles.
.. Leave Deployment disabled for now. A good practice would be to enable it, but for other steps in this series, it will be required to keep it disabled for now.
.. Leave Runtime disabled.
. Click **Next**
. As policy criteria find "Image Registry > Image signature" and drag and drop it to the policy section
+
.ACS Policy Criteria
image::step6-acs_policy_criteria.png?width=600px[ACS Policy Criteria]

. Click on **Select** and select the CoSign integration
+
.ACS Assign CoSign integration to policy
image::step6-acs_assign_cosign.png?width=600px[ACS Assign CoSign integration to policy]

. Click **Next**
. Leave the Policy scope for now and click **Next**
. Review the Policy and **Save** it.

== Prepare the Pipeline Tasks

Now, finally, after all these preparations we are going to integrate ACS into our Pipeline. For this, we will create 2 tasks:

. **acs-image-scan**: Will scan the image for vulnerabilities
. **acs-image-check**: Will verify if the image would violate any security policy, especially the custom policy we have created. 

Both checks will use the **roxctl** command line tool. 

NOTE: It is recommended to add these two Tasks to any Pipeline system you are using when you have ACS installed to leverage the full potential of ACS. It does not matter if you are using Tekton, Jenkins or something else. You can find examples of integrations at the Git repository: https://github.com/stackrox/contributions/.

=== Task acs-image-scan 

To scan for vulnerabilities, create the following Task. It leverages the command line tool **roxctl** which can also be used on your local machine to perform such scans manually.

=== Task Image Check

To verify the policies that are configured in ACS we create the Task **acs-image-check**. 
We will use the command line tool roxctl again.

NOTE: ACS comes with several (80+) build-in policies. Some of them are activated, but none of them configured to enforce a policy. Except, the policy **Trusted Signature Policy** we have created above.

== Extend the Pipeline

Now it is time to extend our Pipeline with the two tasks. Add the following blocks to the Pipeline **secure-supply-chain**:

[source,yml]
----
    - name: acs-image-scan <1>
      params: <2>
        - name: rox_central_endpoint
          value: stackrox-endpoint

          value: stackrox-secret
        - name: image
          value: '$(params.IMAGE_REPO):$(params.IMAGE_TAG)'
        - name: insecure-skip-tls-verify <3>
          value: 'true'
      runAfter: <4>
        - build-sign-image
      taskRef:
        kind: Task
        name: acs-image-scan
    - name: acs-image-check <5>
      params: <6>
        - name: rox_central_endpoint
          value: stackrox-endpoint
        - name: rox_api_token
          value: stackrox-secret
        - name: image
          value: '$(params.IMAGE_REPO):$(params.IMAGE_TAG)'
        - name: insecure-skip-tls-verify <7>
          value: 'true'
      runAfter:
        - build-sign-image <8>
      taskRef:
        kind: Task
        name: acs-image-check
----
<1> Scanning for vulnerabilities
<2> Provide parameters to the Task
<3> Set to 'false' if you have valid certificates.

<5> Scanning security policies
<6> Provide parameters to the Task
<7> Set to 'false' if you have valid certificates.
<8> Run after the Task "build-sign-image"


The Pipeline will now look like this: 

.Pipeline Details
image::step6-pipeline.png[Pipeline Details]


== Execute the Pipeline

Let's trigger another PipelineRun by updating the **README.md** of our source code.
While the previous Tasks should run successfully, let's monitor our two ACS tasks. However, now the Pipeline is running quite long already. This means it is time for a coffee. 

Still here? Good, eventually our two ACS tasks have finished successfully. 

The Task **image-scan** is looking for vulnerabilities and did not find any high-severity issues. 

.ACS Image Scan Result
image::step6-acs_scan.png?width=600px[ACS Image Scan Result]

The Task **image-check** verified the security policies. You can see in the Logs that the **Trusted Signature Policy* was not violated. Another might be shown, but since all other policies are configured to notify only (instead of "enforce"), the whole Task will end successfully. This is good enough for our first tests. The important bit is that the image has been signed.


.ACS Image Check Result
image::step6-acs_check.png?width=600px[ACS Image Check Result]


== Summary
Now we have integrated ACS and are using its powers to scan images for vulnerabilities and check them against security policies. Two Tasks have been created that are executed after the image has been built and are leveraging ACS's command line tool **roxctl**

Whenever vulnerabilities are found, or security policies are violated (if the policy is set to **enforce**) the Pipeline will fail. 

Such tasks should be built in any pipeline you are creating, independently of using ACS or any other security verification tool.

In the next step, we will create a Task that creates a Software Bill of Material (SBOM) for us.
