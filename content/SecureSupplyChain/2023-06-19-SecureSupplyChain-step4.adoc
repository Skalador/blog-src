Besides checking the source code quality, we should also verify if the commit into Git was done by someone/something we trust. It is a good practice to sign all commits to Git. You need to prepare your Git account and create trusted certificates. 

<!--more--> 

CAUTION: I will not describe how exactly you need to configure Git to sign your commit. Verify the following link to learn more about https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits[Signing Commits^]

== Goals

The goals of this step are:

* Verify if the last commit has been signed

== Prerequisites

* Signing public key
* Configured Git to verify your gpg signature

When your commit is signed, Git will show that: 

.Pipeline

== Steps

. Create the following Secret that contains your **PUBLIC** key. 
+

[source,yaml]
----
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: gpg-public-key
  namespace: ci
data:
  public.key: >-
    <Base64 PUBLIC GPG KEY> <1>
type: Opaque
----
<1> Public key, containing BEGIN/END lines base64 encoded.


. Create the following Task: 
+

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: verify-source-code-commit-signature
  namespace: ci
spec:
  description: This task verifies the latest commit and signature against the gpg
    public key
  steps:
  - computeResources: {}
    image: alpine/git:latest
    name: git-verify
    script: |
      set -x <1>

      apk add gpg-agent
      
      gpg --import /workspace/secrets/public.key
      
      git config --global --add safe.directory /workspace/repository
      
      git verify-commit HEAD || (echo "Unable to verify commit at HEAD!" && exit 1)
    workingDir: /workspace/repository
  workspaces:
  - name: repository
  - name: secrets <2>
----
<1> The script to verify the signature of the commit,
<2> The workspace that mounts the Secret containing the gpg key,

. Modify the TriggerTemplate and add the following 3 lines
+

[source,yaml]
----
        workspaces:
...
          - name: secrets
            secret:
              secretName: gpg-public-key <1>
----
<1> The name of the Secret where the public key can be found.

. Update the pipeline to execute the task **verify-commit-signature**, which is running in parallel to the SonarQube scan. 
+

[source,yaml]
----
    - name: verify-commit-signature
      runAfter:
        - pull-source-code <1>
      taskRef:
        kind: Task
        name: verify-source-code-commit-signature <2>
      workspaces: <3>
        - name: repository
          workspace: shared-data
        - name: secrets
          workspace: secrets
  workspaces:
    ...
    - name: secrets <4>
----
<1> This task runs after **pull-source-code** but in parallels with the SonarQube task.
<2> Task reference
<3> Workspaces that are used in this Task
<4> Additional workspace for the Pipeline


The full pipeline objects now look like the following:

The status of the Pipeline now is: 

.Pipeline
image::step4-pipeline.png?width=600px[Pipeline]


== Execute the Pipeline

Let's update the **README.md** of our source code again to trigger another PipelineRun.

Now the 3rd task will verify if the commit was signed. 

.PipelineRun Details
image::step4-PipelineRun_exec.png?width=600px[PipelineRun Details]

In the logs of the Task, we can see that the commit was signed and could be verified.
See:

...
gpg: Good signature from "Thomas Jungbauer <tjungbau@redhat.com>"

.Signature Verification

== Summary
At this stage we have a Pipeline, that pulls our code, does a code analysis, and verifies if the commit has been signed. 
The very next step is to build the image and push it into an Image Registry.
