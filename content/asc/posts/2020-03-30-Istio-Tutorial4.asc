== Modify Gateway and VirtualService
link:posts-output/2020-03-30-Istio-Tutorial3[Issue #3] explains how to get ingress traffic into the Service Mesh, by defining the *Gateway* and the *VirtualService*. We are currently using the default ingress route defined in the _istio_system_ project. +
But what if a custom domain shall be used? +
In such case another route must be defined in the _istio-system_ project and small configuration changes must be applied. 
{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

. First lets create a slightly modified _Gateway.yaml_:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: ingress-gateway-exampleapp
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway # use istio default controller
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 80
      name: http
      protocol: HTTP
    hosts:
    - "hello-world.com" <1>
----
<1> add you custom domain here
+
{nbsp} +
The only difference is at the hosts which was changed from '*' to 'hello-world.com'

. As second change, the VirtualService must be modified as well with the custom domain:
+
VirtualService.yaml:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: ingress-gateway-exampleapp
spec:
  hosts:
  - "hello-world.com" <1>
  gateways:
  - ingress-gateway-exampleapp
  http:
  - match:
    - uri:
        exact: /
    route:
    - destination:
        host: customer
        port:
          number: 8080
----
<1> add you custom domain here

. Replace current objects in OpenShift:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc replace -f Gateway.yaml -n tutorial
oc replace -f VirtualService.yaml -n tutorial
----

. Create a new route under the project _istio-system_:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: hello-world.com <1>
  namespace: istio-system <2>
spec:
  host: hello-world.com <3>
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: istio-ingressgateway <4>
  port:
    targetPort: 8080
----
<1> add you custom domain here
<2> the route must be created at istio-system
<3> add you custom domain here
<4> this is the service as it was created by the operator

== OPTIONAL: Add custom domain to local hosts file
The custom domain *hello-world.com* must be resolvable somehow, pointing to the ingress router of OpenShift.
This can be done, by adding the domain into the local hosts file (with all limitations this brings with it)

[source,bash]
----
# Get IP address of:
oc -n istio-system get route istio-ingressgateway
echo "x.x.x.x hello-world.com" >> /etc/hosts
----

== Create some example traffic
We will reuse the script of link:posts-output/2020-03-30-Istio-Tutorial3[Issue #3] to simulate traffic. 
Since we changed the domain, the connection will go to hello-world.com

[source,bash]
----
sh run-check.sh 1000 hello-world.com
----
{nbsp} +

This will send 1000 requests to our application:
[source,bash]
----
# 0: customer => preference => recommendation v1 from 'f11b097f1dd0': 6626
# 1: customer => preference => recommendation v1 from 'f11b097f1dd0': 6627
# 2: customer => preference => recommendation v1 from 'f11b097f1dd0': 6628
# 3: customer => preference => recommendation v1 from 'f11b097f1dd0': 6629
# 4: customer => preference => recommendation v1 from 'f11b097f1dd0': 6630
# 5: customer => preference => recommendation v1 from 'f11b097f1dd0': 6631
