== Update
To update an operator like Service Mesh, the Operator Life Cycle Manager takes care and automatically updates everything (unless it was configured differently).

For the Service Mesh 1.1 update consult https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/service_mesh/service_mesh_install/updating-ossm.html[Upgrading Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh^] +
It is important to add the version number to the ServiceMeshControlPlane object. The easiest way to do so is:

- Log into OpenShift
- Select the Namespace _istio-system_
- Goto _"Installed Operators > Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh >  ServiceMeshControlPlanes > basic-install > YAML"
- Under spec add the following:
+
[.hidecopy]
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  version: v1.1
----

== Notable Changes
=== ServiceMeshMember Object
With the ServiceMeshMember object it is now possible that a project administrator can add a service to the service mesh, instead relying on the cluster administrator to configure the ServiceMeshMemberRoll.
To do so create the following object (i.e. under the namespace _tutorial_)

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshMember
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: tutorial
spec:
  controlPlaneRef:
    name: basic-install <1>
    namespace: istio-system <2>
----
<1> Name of the ServiceMeshControlPlane object
<2> name of the service mesh namespace
