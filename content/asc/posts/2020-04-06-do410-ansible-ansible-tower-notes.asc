Notes taken during Red Hat course D410 Ansible and Ansible Tower.

== DO410 Ansible and Ansible Tower training notes

=== Ansible installation

- make sure that _libselinux-python_ is installed
- Ansible 2.7 requires python 2.6 or 3.5

[source,bash]
-----------
yum list installed python
-----------

- windows modules implemented in powershell
- ansible requires at least .net 4.0

=== Configuration files

Ansible searches for ansible.cfg in the following order:

- $ANSIBLE_CFG
- ansible.cfg in the current directory
- $HOME/ansible.cfg
- /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

whichever it finds first will be used.

use

[source,bash]
--------
ansible --version
--------

to see which config file is currently used. you can view/dump/see what changed with

[source,bash]
------------
ansible-config [list|dump|view]
------------

=== Default modules

List all available modules via

[source,bash]
----------
ansible-doc -l
----------

For getting help on a specific module use

[source,bash]
-----------
ansible-doc ping
-----------

=== Ad-hoc commmands

To display ansible output on a single line per host for easier readablility use the _-o_ option

[source,bash]
-----------
ansible all -m command -a /bin/hostname -o
-----------

Use the raw module for directly executing commands on remote systems that do not have python installed.

[source,bash]
---------
ansible -m raw
---------

Notes on deploying and working with ansible tower.

System requirements:

- at least 4GB of RAM

- 20GB of disk storage, at least 10GB in /var

Steps for installing:

- set passwords in _inventory_

going to need
