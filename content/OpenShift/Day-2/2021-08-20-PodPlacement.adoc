One of the easiest ways to tell your Kubernetes cluster where to put certain pods is to use a 'nodeSelector' specifications. A nodeSelector defines a key-value pair. 
The selectors are defined inside the specification of the pods and as a label on one or multiple nodes (or machine set or machine config). Only if selector matches the node label, the pod is allowed to be scheduled on that node. 

<!--more--> 

Kubernetes distingushes between 2 types of selectors: 

. _cluster-wide node selectors_: defined by the cluster administrators and valid for the whole cluster
. _project node selectors_: to place new pods inside projects into specific nodes.

WARNING: If no matching label is found, the pod cannot be scheduled. Always label the nodes first.
