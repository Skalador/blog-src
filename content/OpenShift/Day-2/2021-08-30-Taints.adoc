While Node Affinity is a property of pods that attracts them to a set of nodes, taints are the exact opposite. They mark (taint) nodes and allows the node to refuse a pods to be scheduled as long that pod has not a matching toleration configured. 

A common use case would be to mark certain nodes as infrastructure nodes, where only specific pods are allowed to be executed or to taint nodes with a special hardware (i.e. GPU).
