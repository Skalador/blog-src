„_If it is not in GitOps, it does not exist_“ - is a mantra I hear quite often and also try to practice at customer engagements. The idea is to have Git as the only source of truth on what happens inside the environment. That said, https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/everything-as-code/[Everything as Code] is a practice that treats every aspect of the system as a code. Storing this code in Git provides a shared understanding, traceability and repeatability of changes. 

While there are many articles about how to get GitOps into the deployment process of applications, this one rather sets the focus on the *cluster configuration* and tasks system administrators usually have to do. 

<!--more--> 

NOTE: Also check out the article https://blog.stderr.at/openshift/2020-08-06-argocd/[GitOps Argo CD]

== Prerequisites 

It all begins with an OpenShift cluster. Such a cluster must be installed and while we will not discuss a bootstrap of the whole cluster … yes it is possible to even automate the cluster deployment using Advanced Cluster Management as an example, we will simply assume that one cluster is up and running. 

For our setup, an OpenShift cluster 4.12 is deployed and we will use the repository https://github.com/tjungbauer/openshift-clusterconfig-gitops[OpenShift Cluster Bootstrap] to deploy our configuration onto this cluster. This repository shall act as the source of truth for any configuration. Any cluster configuration shall go into that.  

Everything in this repository is based on Helm, which must be available on your local machine. 

NOTE: The openshift-clusterconfig-gitops repository heavily uses the Helm Repository found at https://charts.stderr.at/ 

== Deploy OpenShift-GitOps 

The first thing we need to do is to deploy https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/cicd/gitops/gitops-release-notes.html[OpenShift-GitOps], which is based on the https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/[Argo CD] project. OpenShift-GitOps comes as an Operator and is available to all OpenShift customers. The Operator will deploy and configure Argo CD and provides several custom resources to configure Argo CD Applications or ApplicationSets for example. 

To automate the operator deployment the following shell script can be used: https://github.com/tjungbauer/openshift-clusterconfig-gitops/blob/main/init_GitOps.sh[init_GitOps.sh]. 

NOTE: This Shell script is the only script that is executed manually. It installs and configures Argo CD. Any other operation on the cluster must then be done using GitOps processes. 

. Clone the repository to your local machine
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/tjungbauer/openshift-clusterconfig-gitops.git
----

. Be sure that you are logged in the the required cluster
+
[source,bash]
----
oc whoami --show-server
----

. Execute the init_GitOps.sh
+
[source,bash]
----
./init_GitOps.sh
----

The script will deploy the operator and configure the Argo CD instance. In addition, it will create the so-called *Application of Applications*, which acts as an umbrella Application, that automatically creates all other Argo CD Application(Sets).
For now, the App of Apps is the only Argo CD Application that automatically synchronizes all changes found in Git. This is for security, purposes so you can test the cluster configuration one after another. 

*What will this script do?*

I will not de-assemble the script line by line, but in general, the following will happen: 

. Adding repository https://charts.stderr.at/ and install the Chart https://github.com/tjungbauer/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/openshift-gitops[openshift-gitops]
+
CAUTION: This FIRST OpenShift-GitOps will be deployed with *cluster-admin* privileges since we want to manage the whole cluster configuration. This Argo CD instance should not be used for application deployment. For that, deploy additional instances of GitOps. 

. Waiting for Deployments to become ready

. Deploy the *Application of Applications* that is responsible to automatically deploy a set of Applications or ApplicationSets (see <<The Argo CD Object Manager Application>>)

The following shows the output of the command:

== Logging into Argo CD

At this point we have GitOps and the "*App of Apps*" deployed.
Argo CD comes with a WebUI and a command line tool. The latter must installed to your local environment. In this article, we will use the WebUI. 

Since Argo CD, by default, looks up for the OpenShift group "cluster-admins" to authenticate a user with Argo CD-Administrator privileges and since this group does not yet exist, we need to lookup the initial Administrator password: 

[source,bash]
----
oc extract secret/openshift-gitops-cluster -n openshift-gitops --to=-
# admin.password
<your webUI password>
----

To access the WebUI use the applications menu of the top right corner in Openshift. 

.Argo CD: WebUI Link
image::argocd2/argocd-link.png?width=340px[WebUI Link]

Do not use the button "Login via OpenShift", but instead use the username "admin" and your password from above. 

.Argo CD: Authentication

== The Argo CD Object Manager Application

The *Application of Applications* (short App of Apps) is called *Argo CD Object Manager* and it is the only Argo CD application that is deployed using the init script. This single Argo CD Application has the sole purpose to deploy other Argo CD objects, such as Applications, ApplicationSets and AppProjects. 

.Argo CD: App of Apps
image::argocd2/argocd-app-of-apps.png?width=340px[App of Apps]

It synchronizes everything that is found in the repository in the path: 
_clusters/argocd-object-manager_ (main branch)

Whenever you would like to create a new Argo CD application(set) it is supposed to be done using this App-of-Apps or to be more exact: in the path mentioned above. 

NOTE: The App-of-Apps is the only Argo CD Application (at this moment) that has automatic synchronization enabled. Thus any changes in the App-of-Apps will be propagated automatically as soon as GitOps syncs with Git. 

The current Applications or ApplicationSets that come with the bootstrap repository are for example: 

* Deployment of Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS)
* Deployment of Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM)
* Deployment of basic cluster configuration (i.e. etcd encryption, some UI tweaks ...)
* Deployment of Compliance Operator
* and many more. 

Check out the deployed Argo CD objects or the openshift-clusterconfig-gitops repository.

=== Interlude: What is the difference between Application and ApplicationSets?

{{% expand %}}
*Applications* and *ApplicationSets* are both Custom Resource Definitions that are installed when OpenShift-Gitops (or Argo CD) is installed. 

Applications are the classic way to configure GitOps. However, the main challenge here is that it can only be used to deploy configurations or applications to one target cluster. This limitation is resolved using ApplicationSets by creating multiple Applications out of an ApplicationSet definition. Therefore, it is now possible to deploy the same configuration on multiple clusters. 

In the used Git repository I am using both options, but mainly ApplicationSets. 

Further information can be found at: https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/application-set/

=== Argo CD Object Manager (App-of-Apps) Deep Dive

The object manager application of Argo CD is monitoring the following path: https://github.com/tjungbauer/openshift-clusterconfig-gitops/tree/main/clusters/argocd-object-manager 

It is a Helm Chart that is using the Subchart *helper-argocd* found at https://charts.stderr.at/. However, any configuration should be done in the *values.yaml* file of the main Chart. 

==== Basic values
At the top of the values.yaml file some basic variables are defined. All of them are anchors for the values-file, defining the OpenShift clusters and the Git repository URL.

The following is the example file:

[source,yaml]
----
mgmt-cluster: &mgmtcluster https://kubernetes.default.svc <1>
mgmt-cluster-name: &mgmtclustername in-cluster
production-cluster: &prodcluster https://api.ocp.ispworld.at:6443 <2>
production-cluster-name: &prodclustername prod

repourl: &repourl 'https://github.com/tjungbauer/openshift-clusterconfig-gitops' <3>
repobranch: &branch main
----
<1> First management cluster. This is the local cluster, thus the URL and the name are given
<2> Another cluster, here called "prod"
<3> The URL and the branch to the Git repository 

If you would like to add additional clusters, simply define the URL and the name. The &-value (i.e. &prodcluster) is later used inside the file to refer to the value, so we only have to define the value once instead of multiple times. 

==== Adding ApplicationSets
*ApplicationSets* are used to deploy the same configuration on multiple clusters. Typical, example would be to enable etcd encryption. This is usually done on all clusters, and not only on specific ones. 

To define a list of target clusters, ApplicationSets are using so-called generators and while there are multiple types, two are currently supported by the Helm Chart: 

* List generator
* Cluster generator

NOTE: Technically, the ApplicationSet creates unique Applications for each defined target cluster.

==== Example 1
The following example creates an ApplicationSet that is valid for *ALL* clusters:

[source,yaml]
----
helper-argocd: <1>
...
  applicationsets:
  ...
    generic_clusterconfig: <2>
      enabled: true <3>
      description: "Deploy generic cluster configuration, like banners or etcd encryption"
      labels:
        category: cluster-configuration <4>
      path: clusters/all/clusterconfig/ <5>
      helm:
        per_cluster_helm_values: true <6>
      generatorclusters: [] <7>
  #    repourl: "" # Optional <8>
  #    targetrevision: "" # Optional <9>
----
<1> Bypassing the values to the subchart "helper-argocd"
<2> Name of the application that will be created. To make it unique in Argo CD the name of the cluster will be added as prefix. For example *in-cluster-generic-clusterconfig* (Underscores will be transformed to dashes)
<3> Enabled true or false ... I use this switch in any Chart as common practice
<4> Optional: A set of labels 
<5> The path inside the Git repository, here we will use the definitions found at _clusters/all/clusterconfig/_
<6> Using cluster specific values files for each cluster to set defined values per cluster. For example: A console banner usually looks different for production and development clusters. *These files must then be called <clustername>-values.yaml (for example: https://github.com/tjungbauer/openshift-clusterconfig-gitops/tree/main/clusters/all/clusterconfig)*
<7> Define a list of clustesr. For any cluster in this list an Argo CD Application will be created, called <clustername>-generic-clusterconfig. *An empty list means ALL clusters*
<8> Optional: Overwrite the *repourl* defined at the beginning of the values files
<9> Optional: Overwrite the *repobranch* defined at the beginning of the values files

CAUTION: In order to let the ApplicationSet create Applications for multiple clusters, the external cluster must be configured in Argo CD first. 

The result would be the following Application:

.Argo CD: ApplicationSet
image::argocd2/argocd-appset-ex.png?width=340px[ApplicationSet]

This is an Application created out of the ApplicationSet, using the clustername (in-cluster) as prefix. 

==== Example 2
The following example creates an ApplicationSet that is valid for *a list of* clusters: 

[source,yaml]
----
helper-argocd: <1>
...
  applicationsets:
  ...
    install_application_gitops: <2>
      enabled: true <3>
      description: "Deploy a 2nd GitOps instance for application deployments"
      labels:
        category: project <4>
      path: clusters/management-cluster/management-gitops <5>
      generatorlist: <6>
        - clustername: *mgmtclustername
          clusterurl: *mgmtcluster
     syncPolicy:
       autosync_enabled: false <7>
----
<1> Bypassing the values to the subchart "helper-argocd"
<2> Name of the application that will be created. To make it unique in Argo CD the name of the cluster will be added as prefix. For example *in-cluster-generic-clusterconfig* (Underscores will be transformed to dashes)
<3> Enabled true or false ... I use this switch in any Chart as common practice
<4> Optional: A set of labels 
<5> The path inside the Git repository
<6> A list of target clusters, defining *clustername* and *clusterurl*. Here the Helm anchor defined at the beginning of the values.yaml is used
<7> Enable AutoSync true/false

==== Adding Application
While ApplicationSets will create Applications for Argo CD, sometimes pure Applications might be required. This can be done as well. Now one cluster can be defined only: 

[source,yaml]
----
helper-argocd: <1>
...
  applications:
  ...
    in-cluster-init-rhacs: <2>
      enabled: true
      server: *mgmtcluster <3>
      namespace: {}
      project: default
      description: "Initialize Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security and deploy Central and SecuredCluster"
      labels:
        category: security
        solution: rhacs
      source: <4>
        path: charts/rhacs-full-stack
        repourl: "https://github.com/tjungbauer/helm-charts"
        targetrevision: "main"
----
<1> Bypassing the values to the subchart "helper-argocd"
<2> Name of the application that will be created. To make it unique in Argo CD the name of the cluster will be added as prefix. For example *in-cluster-generic-clusterconfig* (Underscores will be transformed to dashes)
<3> Deploy on this cluster URL
<4> Define the repository: URL, path and branch.

== Secrets
when it comes to GitOps and Kubernetes, Secret Management will become a topic sooner or later. It is *NOT safe* to store Secrets as plain text in Git. Instead, some encryption must be some. 

The are basically two ways to handle them:

. Encrypt the secret and store it in Git (i.e. Sealed Secrets) 
. Create a reference to the secret stored in an external Secret Management System (i.e. Vault) and only keep this reference in Git. 

Both have their advantages. I nice blog article about the options was created by 2 colleagues of mine: https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/a-guide-to-secrets-management-with-gitops-and-kubernetes[A Guide to Secrets Management with GitOps and Kubernetes]

I am currently using Sealed Secrets to encrypt my sensitive information. These objects are stored in Git and cannot be decrypted unless I share my key. 

So the very first application that I synchronize is always (*always*) the Sealed Secret application. I then just install my very own key and can decrypt all my very secure data in the cluster. 

== Summary 

With all this in place, many Argo CD Applications are created but not synchronized. (I do not automatically sync since I use this Bootstrap repository to create Demo-Environments and not everything is needed for every Demo)

>IMG><<<
.Argo CD: Applications
image::argocd2/argocd-apps.png?width=340px[Argo CD Applications]

You can now use these Applications to configure your clusters. Out of the box, several possibilities are available. For example,: 

* Fully install and configure Compliance Operator: Here the Operator is deployed and set up to perform CIS Benchmark checks on the cluster
* Or enable ETCD encryption

and many more.
